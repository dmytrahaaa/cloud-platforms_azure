worldnews,"&gt; Industry in China is still deeply entwined with the state. The notion that China just suddenly became capitalist is pervasive and misguided.

That's called state capitalism with a centralised planning system not socialism. 

&gt;Socialism refers to state ownership of the means of production

No, the workers own it, not the state. What usually happens is that the state assumes control over the means of production via authoritarianism. 

&gt;The Chinese government and communist party directly run the economy 

CCP is about as Communist as the Democrat People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) is Democratic. 

&gt;China is actually less socialist than Nordic model countries in the realm of wealth redistribution and tax rates.

Social democratic societies such as the Nordic Model operate under a capitalist framework. They just have generous welfare nets. 

&gt;Perhaps you can't actually call China socialist, perhaps they're something new and unique.

Not even Chinese people consider their government socialist. Words have meanings. 

Even under a ""state owned system"", the wealth needs to be redistributed and funneled into public welfare systems. The state should also not profit off of the enterprises and industries they own. 

To put it simply, you are incorrect in your assessment. China is a ruthless, authoritarian capitalist society that will break any rules needed to get ahead. That's why they are where they are in such a short span of time.",0,8

Despite receiving trillions of dollars in oil revenue over recent decades, Venezuela is in the midst of an unprecedented economic collapse, owing precisely to the redistributionist programs that Sanders has extolled as a model for the U.S. economy.

To complete the heel turn he'd have to kill Dany and/or his siblings to reveal his true nature.

I can't quite connect all the dots, but i do think there has to be some last swerve of this caliber to justify having the night king threat end so early. i figure most likely it's something like this, or at the least, it would involve dany nuking KL and forcing Jon to bring her to justice or something. I don't like that idea necessarily either, so Bran being the final boss would be both surprising but also not completely illogical.

It is super tiring and boring to talk to. I will happily chat to anyone, literally anyone, if they're just chill and being themselves and having a good time.

The other thing is that sometimes men try this, and even though they get better at conversations etc, they still think it's unfair or something when they don't get a girlfriend in like a week. It isn't about being ""friendzoned"" because you're the worst, it's the fact that not everyone will be your perfect bloody match. Think about how many people you meet and either think are just okay, or don't like that much. Then apply that same statistic to finding a partner, and heighten it a bit because you have to REALLY like someone and click with them to want to put your face close to their face (maybe unless drunk idk). It is NORMAL to struggle to find a good partner, and women struggle with this too, everyone does.

Oh yeah also being ""nice"" and ""respectful"" is literally the bare fucking minimum for being a good partner. Like, that's great, but it doesn't mean the universe owes you a partner.

relationship_advice,"If the relationship is not wholly fulfilling, it's probably a sign that the two of you aren't meant to be together. Also you are only 18, so while it could be possible, she is likely not the one. People who get together at a young age often don't end up staying together forever. Some do, but I would say, based on what you've said, it doesn't sound like it. Before you said you broke up with her because it didn't feel right, so you were likely right then. What you need to do is sit yourself down and think about whether or not you can continue this relationship. Can the good outweigh the bad or is there too much bad? I can't speak to it, obviously, because I am not you. Ultimately, you need to figure out if you can continue on in this relationship or not.",0,1

&gt; The four-page letter that Mr. Barr sent to Congress two days later gave little detail about the special counsel&amp;#039;s findings and created the impression that Mr. Mueller&amp;#039;s team found no wrongdoing, allowing Mr. Trump to declare he had been exonerated.

&gt; When Mr. Mueller&amp;#039;s report was released on April 18, it painted a far more damning picture of the president and showed that Mr. Mueller believed that significant evidence existed that Mr. Trump obstructed justice.

&gt; The senior department officials also found Mr. Mueller&amp;#039;s rationale for stopping short of deciding whether Mr. Trump committed a crime to be confusing and contradictory, and they concluded that Mr. Mueller&amp;#039;s report showed that there was no case against Mr. Trump.

gameofthrones,"Any critique here gets downvoted and then the old “don’t watch it then” bitchy remark. So expect that.
   Also, I try to suspend a lot of disbelief as far as military and martial and commentators sense tactics go. This show touts girl power to the enth degree especially lately and that’s where Lyanna Mormont and such comes from. Don’t have much of an issue with that. Just think that Aryas been pumped up entirely too much. She was a half trained assassin who spent way more time getting her ass kicked than kicking ass. As I said, Jaime or Theon killing the NK would’ve made much more sense than Arya doing it. It just didn’t fit for me. 
    The crypt scene was a huge waste. The fact that dead Starks came out of their resting place to kill should’ve been presented differently, not to mention, what’s the statute of limitations on the NK resurrections? Those were 100+ year old dead bodies. 
    I did like how Melisandre died however. Her purpose was carried out, she took her amulet off and her very old body gave up, that could’ve been slightly more epic but whatever. I understand that our lead cast can’t die unceremoniously, but soldiers die with no pomp or circumstance all the time. 
   There were things done right, and things done wrong. The music and cinematography were completely on point, it was the storyline that I disliked, especially the whole Walking Dead in the library experience Arya had....very cheap. 
    And I’m expecting shit for this, but halfway through this season already and I am not liking what I’ve seen thus far. After S4, the show went downhill. I still love it as a whole though.",0,1

nba,"Let's calculate how much we have to make the three worth to get to this. If it was worth 2.675 points instead of 3 would we achieve the perfect harmony of offensive strategy? 

Let's go all out and embrace the video game world. The NBA and video games seem to have the same general audience already, why not further blur those lines? 

Getting back to back blocks on the same player in the same possession gives your team a red shell and automatically forces the opposing coach to sub out that player in shame at the next dead ball and keep them on the bench for at least five minutes of game time. 

Maybe add rewards for consecutive made shots of the same type being worth more or less. Hit three ""three's"" in a row and unlock a holographic power star. Power stars grant you +1 points per made shot, +0.5 points per assisted shot, and immunity from foul calls for 30 seconds.

news,"Thanks for the interesting response, this sheds a bit more light on how it came about. 

I've been trying to understand what was actually going on during the cold war in SA, and how people in the US and abroad felt about it, as it's not something that's taught in US schools. 

For example, was the coup against Arbenz in Guatamala viewed similarly? 

Do people believe Armas was better than Arbenz? I've heard people say this and all the other similar coups in SA were victories for freedom and democracy,  but in every case I've read (guatamala, hondurous, chile, nicaragua) the people who replaced the communist/socialists were far more repressive and anti-democratic than those they replaced.

In states where it is not mandated, you are *still* prohibited from selling a gun to someone known to be a prohibited person, so owners will frequently require some proof to that effect, such as a concealed carry permit. Gun owners have called for, time and again, the NICS system to be opened to the public, even at a nominal fee, so that they can do their own background checks when selling their firearms. The only other exception I know of to the background check requirement are some states which allow things like a concealed carry license/permit in lieu, but to have one of those, you must *already* have passed a background check.",0,59

To put it shortly, I was in an abusive relationship for almost a year and (upon breakup) my now ex pretended to kill themself three times in the span of 12 hours. I remember mourning them so vividly, screaming about how i had killed them to a friend who later suggested that I talk again to them because we were both just kids despite being aware of what they had put me through even prior to the event. Every time they returned again, I felt betrayed and conflicted because on one hand I was so, so happy they were alive but on the other I couldn't breathe knowing they had used the thing they had done to get together with me (I had to ""confess"" I loved them to stop them from killing themselves on a call one night because I was dating someone that wasn't them who I ended up dumping after we drifted apart - I really hope they're doing better these days) to hurt me so much. 

I've been to therapy, it's not the best but it's helping. Talking about it has helped a lot but there's really not much you can do when you're so young I guess. I'm still trying to come to terms with the whole ordeal as the (almost) year of emotional manipulation and abuse is something I am still feeling the repercussions of. 

Despite that I'm here, I've tried to take my life about 12 times in the past year (majority being post break up) but never gone through fully at the thought of the wonderful friends I've made after regaining my autonomy I'd lost due to ex's controlling nature - a specific one being someone I regard as a sister at this point.

However, I don't think that should nullify the rules we've been playing with since the beginning. Fighting off dozens of wights because you're a badass swordsman? Sure! Surviving as an overweight coward who fell multiple times, has next-to-zero battle training, and whimpered while being overwhelmed? Doesn't make sense. Being completely surrounded and backed into a wall without the space to even swing your sword, and then magically being ok the next scene? Doesn't make sense. If you want these legendary characters, actually show them beating the odds rather than just baiting their deaths, cutting away, and then showing them safe.

3) **You** said the republicans would never elect a black person as president, but there only has to be one black person who could be elected as president to prove that's not true; you're now saying ""one or two isn't proof of anything.""

The truth is, the only way for me to prove that there is a black person that can be elected president by the republican party is for there to already have been a black person who has been elected president by the republican party.  Otherwise, you can always just say that person would never get elected.  Without Obama, you'd be in the exact same position with respect to the democrat party.  Obama was the most talented politician we've in decades -- had he been a republican, I think he would have been elected president as a republican.

But you're correct that to the extent that Rosenstein had some control over aspects of it (like his judgment with Barr after mueller submitted the report) it would be improper for Trump to discuss any of the ins and outs of that decision or influence it in any way. I don't think that is implied by Rods letter though.

AOC made some other good comments about pelosi in that article which explain policy positions.

https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-congress-interview-797214/

&gt; One thing that is notable about the speaker [Pelosi] is that she does believe that the Democratic Party should be a progressive party. She is in the difficult position of having to juggle all of these different wings within the party, but her personal politics are very progressive. I have not found an issue where we are really opposed...

&gt; I don’t want to compromise where we’re going, but I’m willing to compromise on how we get there. I believe in single-payer health care, so that every American is covered with physical, mental and dental health care that is free of cost. That’s my vision. If I lobby the caucus enough so that our most conservative members fight for a public option, that’s a huge win...

I'd encourage you to consider the hypothesis that it not's ""centrist"" dems that suck so much, it's really the people they represent. (Due largely to the authoritarian propaganda machine).

A good piece of evidence that this is real, and not made up by neo-liberals to stop progressive legislation, is to study US populations and their representatives. 

There's no ""AOC of Alabama"", even though I guarantee there are people living in Alabama who could be their AOC.

The best progressives in congress right now all represent high left populations. And when you start talking about statewide and national representative strategy, it's really important to accept the reality of those populations, keeping the house requires not getting the constituents of those people pissed off, and just trying to not give a supermajority to the GOP in the senate requires the same.

politics,"That's the conventional wisdom, but has it really been proven to work? The biggest criticisms I've heard about losing democratic tickets over the years was that they lacked clear message. Voters didn't have a strong sense of what the candidate(s) actually stood for. Certainly Clinton/Kaine suffered from a less clear definition of what they stood for compared to their competition (as ugly as what Trump stood for was, it was at least crystal clear).

&amp;#x200B;

I really wonder if picking a VP that is ideologically similar, that can passionately articulate what their administration will represent, would be a better strategy than trying to spread the ticket's appeal with some other swing state Senator/Governor with a different ideology. A Warren/Sanders ticket would have an incredibly strong brand among Democrats and progressives. I think a strong ticket identity will fare against Trump in 2020 than the usual Democrat approach of trying to broaden reach.",0,1

AskReddit,"Not a medical worker and in my case this isn't about haunting last words. Sometimes not even knowing is haunting.  


My grandmother had dementia. And my siblings as well as my parents were always around her and my grandfather to take care of them. We went away for a three week vacation and my dads sisters came around to watch my grandparents and take care of them. When we got back my grandmother's entire demeanor had changed. She went from loving us, talking to us daily and having full trust to out right hating us. She screamed at my older brother and our mother to get out of her house and never set foot in it again. We were accused of beating, stealing, coercing, and other crimes against my grandparents.  
My father's sisters used my grandmothers dementia to warp her mind into believing we were out to get her despite being there for her and my grandfather for years prior, trying to keep them going through their rapidly decreasing health. My grandparents were fairly wealthy and we knew my aunts were trying to get their money. We went to court twice with them to defend ourselves against the accusations. My aunts never won, but I still never saw my grandparents again. The damage was done.  


My grandmother passed about two years later and my grandfather followed after another two. I will never know if my grandmother, who practically raised me and my older brother while our parents worked their butts off, died hating us, loving us, or maybe not evening remembering. And I will never know if they died alone or had someone beside them. I think of both of them often and it still haunts me.

13% range buff on his Q? Rank 1 slow of 50% for 2 fucking seconds?! That's god damn amazing.

And now you can just spam E in every trade since it's free. 

And his rank 3 ult just got a fucking 30% range buff. I bet you can ult from drake to Baron now... That's a big deal!

There's a real chance that Tahm Kench comes away from these changes stronger than before... The way I see it, his W being good is now dependent on Tahm having flash.

Bio was my first period, so it's the first place I'd go in the morning to put my stuff down before wandering around until the day started. This day though I had gotten shit sleep so I put my stuff down and lay my head on the desk to try and get some napping in before I had to be truly awake.

Collen was also in the bio room, getting early morning tutoring from the teacher. The teacher was this nice little Asian lady who had only been teaching a couple of years at this point. She's going over a past test with him, and he's clearly not picking up on much of anything that she says, and so he's getting annoyed.

As for my response to your points, I can see what you mean about the Blues with what you say up to this point:

&gt;Can you honestly say that the Blues are worse than Senators or Oilers before the season ? Hell no.

And I agree with everything you've said up until that point. You're right, starting the season on paper the Blues were supposed to actually be one of the more dominant teams in the NHL with their offseason acquisitions. But it was more than just the goaltending that had problems. At one point we had the lowest Goals For in the entire league which is obviously not a problem that bringing in a new goaltender solved. Coaching helped there which is why Berube also got the nomination for Jack Adams, but for nearly everything else Binnington has pretty much been the solution. Our defense looks a hell of a lot better than it did originally, but to be honest it still looks pretty weak and I'm seeing Binnington have to make 1 to 2 desperation saves nearly every game. 

But what I'm trying to say is that no, before the season I wouldn't have said the Blues were going to be worse than the Senators or Oilers. But after watching 4 straight months of them prove that wrong, I was resigned to the fact that we were going to finish 31st in the league. I had 0 hope on Jan 1st that they'd ever turn it around. When they turned it around I was absolutely floored as a Blues fan. A team doesn't magically turn into a scoring powerhouse just because a goaltender starts heating up. And yet somehow, they did. Even when Berube first came on nothing seemed to change. It wasn't until Binnington's debut that they started dominating. I've never seen anything like it in my life as a hockey fan. 

As for how Binnington is not nominated for Vezina, his competition is other goaltenders who have more games under their belt with equally incredible stats. I think that when you're comparing goalie to goalie you have to look at games played very objectively and can say ""well obviously Binner didn't come close to the GP that Vasi did and he still had incredible stats"". 

But with Calder, my opinions on that are different. You shouldn't be able to compare goaltenders to skaters honestly. 32 games as a goalie is still a large chunk when you consider there are plenty of starters that only hit ~50. So when everyone says ""Binnington's played less than half the season"" that's technically true, but he's also played damn near the ENTIRE half of the season whereas plenty of other starters play ~15 games over half the season but they do it all season long. Add in the fact that no NHL goalie ever *starts* the first game of the season for a debut (goalies literally have to wait for 1 of 2 goalies to go down before they get a call up in nearly every case) whereas a skater can just get called up and poof you toss one of the other 12 forwards you've got down to the minors. 

Look I know he's not going to win it over Petey. But goalies aren't expected to get a call up at the start of the year so without taking candidates like this one seriously you'll never get Calder-winning goaltenders.",0,1

His first game was honestly really awesome but after that it really became bleak.

Everybody in the building from keim to the players all defended Rosen and still have after being traded . It would’ve been very easy for anybody to throw Rosen under the bus but not one person did.

&gt;wight must be killed or else it will keep attacking at full strength

This part actually confuses me. We can see very clearly in Jorah's final stand that a single slash to any part of the body kills them instantly. Need to go back and confirm, but I'm under the impression that a single slash or stab kills them, as does how White Walkers die (seen with both Valyrian steel and dragonglass).

&gt;focused the enemy's attack to a relatively small surface area  
&gt;  
&gt;area of Winterfell that must be defended by an onslaught is much larger

True, I'd agree with that. I guess we can even the playing fields by discussing from the point AFTER the walls have been breached (e.g. Elven archers prepared for shooting upon breach). But going back to the major point, Winterfell could've done a heck of a lot better job in coordination and strategy. Dragons were also utilized so poorly.

I’ve always been kind of a goth, into spooky aesthetics, Halloween and horror movies, but I knew very little about the real life funeral industry and estate planning. I take some comfort in knowing that my loved ones will have an easier time than I have had when I go because there will be fewer financial things to figure out, and my wishes about my remains are made clear and are written down. Even passwords and accounts to be closed are recorded. I know it’s just the dumb, mundane stuff, it’s something that I can do for them now, while I’m still young and healthy, so it’s one or two fewer things they’ll have to deal with. I know it sounds very pragmatic, but it really makes me feel better. The grief comes in waves. It’s not on a schedule, it’s unpredictable.",0,2

From Iron Man - ""proof Tony has a heart"", the fact that Tony likes cheeseburgers, and that Tony wishes he could have said goodbye to his father

From Iron Man 2 - when Tony says ""it's always you"" at the end of his recording in the Benatar, it references when he made Pepper CEO and said ""it's you. it's always been you"". Additionally, this film fleshes out Tony's relationship with his father.

From Thor 1 and Captain America 1 - the city where Odin fought the frost giants and where Red Skull found the tesseract is Tønsberg, the same city where New Asgard is placed in this movie. 

From Captain America 1 - ""I could do this all day"", and then Cap and Bucky's lines when they say goodbye to each other at the start of this film are the same as when they say goodbye at the end of Endgame except switched - Cap says what Bucky said before and Bucky says what Cap said before. ""Don't do anything stupid."" ""you're taking all the stupid with you.""

From Captain America 2 - ""On your left"" &amp; the elevator scene

Age of Ultron - the things that Tony is mad at Cap for saying were said in Age of Ultron. ""We'll lose."" ""Then we'll do that together too.""

Seems like it would be more logical to just make some exceptions in the law for these instances than to just dismiss it with a hand wave and say it’s fine because it’s a minority of felons. As if it’s either ALL felons can vote or NO felons can vote, which is a false dichotomy; you can allow some/most felons to vote if you write the law as such. I think Florida’s amendment restores voting rights to all felons except murder and sexual offenses or something to that effect.

worldnews,"&gt; After all, when has a country ever successfully used guns to resist an oppressive government and gone on to free themselves and create the most successful, productive democracy and documents like a constitution that guarantees personal rights and freedoms like speech and voting and free thought and religion? It's never happened.

The Revolutionary War in the US is much different than the situation is Venezuela. It was the colonies collectively working together with a common government and army against another country. This is more like a civil war. The Civil War in the US is an example you are seeking, except it was unsuccessful for the people resisting the government. Not saying the current dictator in Venezuela is the good guy or anything, just saying having guns isn't necessarily going to get you anywhere. This is a complex situation and I'm not saying people shouldn't be able to rise up and fight for what they believe, I'm simply saying that having a gun doesn't give you the power you necessarily think it does. Unorganized civilians with guns is not an Army, has no infrastructure, and is not a match for a military or police forces. The best thing people can do is continue to protest, I don't think a few shootouts in the streets are going to change much. It will take time for the economic sanctions and pressure from the outside to make Maduro step down but a little time is a much better price than a bloody civil war.",0,-1

politics,"Rage-induced mass shootings do not require the shooter to have a conceal carry permit, unfortunately.

The problem is that while it is difficult to get a conceal carry permit in Colorado, it’s absurdly easy to buy guns anyway.  Any person over 18 years old that can pass a low-level background check run by the store can buy long guns, and anyone over 21 can buy hand guns too.  Open carry is permit-free, so in a way, the mass shooter isn’t even breaking the law until they’re inside the building and fire the first shot.

The minimal burden at the bottom - requiring a safety course and issuing through police department (naturally skeptical of citizens having guns) rather than a private dealer (who actively wants to sell guns - as many as possible) - makes the big difference in gun violence.

marvelstudios,"Nebula and Gamora were there. Nakia and Sif weren't even in the movie, and I'm sure they would have put Nakia in the scene if they got Lupita Nyong'o in the movie. Sif would probably raise to many questions. I already explained to you why it's a stupid to compare to 12 male characters showing up. 
The reason there aren't as many female characters, is because the people that watch these movies used to be mainly men, but it's starting to change, which is why you're starting to see more female characters on screen. There also aren't nearly as many iconic female Marvel characters to adapt to the big screen as there are male characters, which makes it more difficult to have as many females on screen. Not to mention that having more female characters, just for the sake of having as many of them as male characters is the wrong way to go about it. If the character is great, and there's a big demand for it, make a movie about him or her. Don't make a movie about a character, just because she's a woman.
The point is that the scene was forced and genuinely took people out of the movie, men and women alike. The characters didn't gather there because the story warranted it, they didn't even know each other, and after they had their girl power money shot, they didn't even do anything together, they just went about killing goons individually.

AskReddit,"You can definitely be sneaky. Many players play a sort of lurking style, cutting off rotations and backstabbing. Throwing down smokes to limit the opposing team's view is also very important, as well as sneakily walking through enemy smokes to catch them off guard. There's tons of boost areas too which many players don't know about.

Movement in this game is insane too. Can't climb anything? Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/MhrrRf7VaeU) posted just a few days ago. Movement in CS:GO has a ton of little things to it - just watch a pro like FalleN on train back in his prime.

Turn a corner and get headshot? You can jiggle peek. Shoulder peek. Flash them off. Molly them out of their position. Smoke them off. The game is a lot more than just peeking angles and clicking heads. Utility is huge in high-level CS:GO; there's a reason why teams like Astralis are so great on maps like Inferno. You'll get naded down to half your health before you can even see one of them. Conversely, you can nade them down. Mind games. Do I try to take map control and risk taking utility damage? Or do I give up map control, take somewhere else, and go back once the other team has used their utility/rotated?

I can't see how you can judge CS:GO this harshly with only 40 hours played; like u/itirate said, it's a lot more than clicking heads.",0,9

gameofthrones,"1. What are Tyrion and the rest of the south supposed to do? Daenerys has two dragons (three at the time of the Tarly's execution) and two full armies that she's controlling. And I flat out disagree with the notion that Tyrion as a character HAD to do something even if he disagreed with the killing of the Tarly's. Followers questioning the decisions of their leader without acting is something that happens in real life. The consequences of Daenerys' actions are that people don't view her the same as they used to; Tyrion and Varys have lost some faith in her. We still haven't seen the end of her story either, so let's see how it plays out. 

2. The Waif was sent to kill Arya, and Arya fended her off, killing her in the process. Is she supposed to be penalized for surviving and fighting for her life? We saw the consequences of Arya's actions of killing Meryn Trant, they just didn't play out with Arya losing her life, it was the Waif. The Many-Faced God was repaid with a face. Furthermore, we've always known that Jaqen H'ghar is somewhat fond of Arya, so it's not out of character that he would allow her to leave. She completed her training.

3. The stories of Dorne, The Reach and The Stormlands were complete. And if you disagree with me, that's fine, but sometimes you have to sacrifice story for other story. There are only so many episodes in a season, and so many seasons of a show. I don't feel like I missed anything in those locations.

4. The people of the North realized that they needed the Wildlings on their side to fight the war, and Jon made this point numerous times after being questioned about it.

5. Tyrion's strategic blunders have been acknowledged by Dany, but again, the story isn't complete. She clearly thinks that he is still the best person for the job despite some errors in judgment, which she approved by the way, so it's not all on him.

6. Cersei is the clear next in line after Tommen's death. She's the blood of the former king and there's nobody else that could fill the role. She's also ruling with an iron fist, so people are scared of her. She has The Mountain by her side and just showed that she is capable and willing to kill a lot of people. Who's going to challenge that? The people of King's Landing so they can get wiped out by the Lannister Army? And you're right, I don't care at all that Kevan Lannister was killed and i'm glad no more time was spent on that. He was a worthless character.

7. The Dothraki charging into battle was meant to draw the Night King out so Dany and Jon could jump him with their dragons. Sometimes you have to make sacrifices to win the war. Did it play out as intended? No. Was it the absolute optimal strategic decision? No. Jon and Dany aren't great war tacticians and they did make strafing runs over the horde of Wights, but Dany decided to pursue the NK and Jon went after her. Dany isn't a rational character, so this isn't a plot hole in my opinion.",0,2

HOWEVER, if I ever have kids, particularly girls, I certainly will do what your wife did and help my daughter by her first vibrator at an age which children typically start masturbating (like 12-14) and have an open and candid conversation with them about masturbating and what is healthy and what isn’t, and which vibrators can be used with which lube, etc. if I have boys, I would ensure my husband or the boys father have a similar conversation with him, but them lube and tissues and whatever else they may need, and talk to them  about the same types of things, what’s healthy and unhealthy, and about porn and what is realistic and what isn’t and to make sure they understand that porn is imaginary. Girls need this conversation too. I would ensure that my daughters knows that the conversations we have together are confidential and aren’t shared with my husband or her siblings (similar to conversations about puberty and mensuration), and I except the same to happen with my husband and my son, however we each need to know that these conversations are taking place so neither one is surprised. But I do understand why your wife hid it from you, she wanted her daughter to trust her and knew that you would react the way you did, but she probably should have gone about it in a different way. 

 You NEED to start early with these conversations and sex positivity because if you start too late, like 16 or 17, there’s a good chance your child has already started having sex and thinks they know everything already, these conversations need to start far earlier than you may think is appropriate for them to be effective. 

I teach high school sex Ed, mainly to freshmen, and by the time I get to the sex ed unit with my kiddos, who are an average age of 14, many of them are already sexual active and already think they know everything about sex And are unwilling to listen to me... 12 is NOT too early for a young woman to start exploring her body sexually, and it’s far better to be under the guidance of her mom than entirely on her own, possibly sticking things up her vagina and causing a yeast infection or never getting the opportunity to orgasm on her own and then jumping into sex far too early just for sexual gratification.

My advice to you is to give up the fight about your daughter owning a vibrator bought by her mother and start a conversation with your wife about being a team and making these decisions together. Realize that while you are your daughters parent, your wife is a woman and knows a bit more about female sexuality than you do and that you may be wrong on this one, but you BOTH should be discussing these things together privately before discussing them with your children. Your issue isn’t that your wife allowed your daughter to buy a vibratory to masturbate with, your issue is your communication with your wife, THATS what you need to work on.",0,3

Not sure how having one chapter and dying is a metric for intelligence?

&gt;She makes those blunders because she's losing her mind. I don't know how you missed that. That's why we have Cersei's POV in that book, to see her descent into madness.

Saying that she is ""losing her mind"" is a gross exaggeration. Cersei is paranoid about prophecy after Joffrey's death and that's it. She is not exactly mad in a medical sense. And Cersei was always stupid, from the very beginning. It wasn't as apparent initially because there was always someone who had her under control - Robert, Tyrion, Tywin. The only time before Tywin's death when she was in charge was shortly after Ned's death and Tywin was so appalled at how the things were handled, he quickly sent Tyrion to take charge instead.

&gt;Also, Cersei makes similar blunders in the show. Like legitimizing and militarizing the sparrows.

Yes, because the showwriters wanted to adapt that storyline.

&gt;Cersei in the books also organizes the downfall of Margaery. In the show, she doesn't really do shit to bring down Margaery. Instead a male whore does it in the most convoluted way.

She tried to organise Margaery's downfall, what she did organise was in fact her own downfall as she fell into the very trap she herself created for Margaery. While Margaery is about to go free relatively untouched and the Tyrells took over KL. All because of Cersei's ""plan"".",0,2

I personally, like a lot of people with credit, wasn’t looking for the utter gamble of property spec and being a shitty slum lord - but was invested in an actual business.

Detroit’s property taxes did not go by market value, they went by city appraised value - which was often time 10x the market value, or more, especially in BE or Indian Village.

I grew up in Warrendale and lived in various neighborhoods my entire life save a stint as a teenager and my time in Iraq. I’ve lived everywhere from SW to Delray to the East Side to Downtown and even in the end, around Eastern Market - where some friends owned a building and when they rejected a low ball price from out of state investors they started hammering us with inspectors until they were forced to sell due to code violation fines for dumb, bureaucratic shit.

Do you think people in Detroit 15 years ago just had the money and credit to engage in housing speculation - or compete with outside money that came flooding in after 2008? Everyone was trying to hold on to what they had left. This comment is astoundingly divorced from reality. Bizzaro world shit.

https://prospect.org/article/destruction-black-wealth

Up until 2011, when I left, the proceeding years were not ripe with opportunity - they were a desperate struggle. “Why didn’t you just get a bumch of lines of credit to buy a bunch of

No, you didn’t “support Detroit” by sticking a D on the back of your car, coming down for DEMF or to stumble back to the MGM lot after getting blotto at McShanes or Greektown from OLdS. You were engaging in commerce, trade - that’s it.

No I would not live on the east side again. Why would I? My people are all gone. The connections, friends, family, business partners - two decades worth of social capital scattered to the wind.

I left to another city to go to university and stayed abouts. I make sure to not clean up my neighborhood TOO much, not to make the bus stops TOO much, because it’s all that’s keeping a 5 guys off my corner and a Dan Gilbert from realizing we’re conveniently close to downtown. I may own my house now, but a lot my neighbors don’t - and I recognize that a city is people, not a just a place for people to come play in once in a while.

And for real, I used to walk all the way down Grand River from E. Grand to the Leland on Friday’s/Saturday’s and never had a problem -   Corktown was never even that bad, and far better than tons of areas further from downtown including the one I lived in. You just couldn’t walk around drunk and clueless. That’s it.

Do yourself a favor and go read some Community Economic Development from any Uni if you actually desire to have an informed opinion - MSU has plenty of good, empirical, work. Gentrification became such a commonly dirty word because of how intensely all of

AmItheAsshole,"NAH I might not be the most qualified to say this but then again you are asking this on Reddit. I feel you should be allowed to feel this way about seeing your daughter looking at these kind of things but I don't think you approached the situation in the best way, maybe talking to her and getting some woman's insight from your wife may have resulted in a better outcome. Although your wife has a valid point in trying to help along a healthy sex life she shouldn't have undermined your parental authority like that in front of your daughter. You should talk to your wife in private about respecting each other's authority as well as talk to your daughter together in order to help her and work out some understanding among the three of you. I know it may be uncomfortable to talk about these things but it's better than having your daughter grow up thinking sex is a bad thing that shouldn't be thought of or even becoming rebellious and doing things she really shouldn't.

In unreal tournament and quake its basically a quest to dominate the power up rotation once you get a good gun also its a case of spawning near a good gun, getting to the power ups first etc. Fighting games its a case of guessing the right frame and the right counter at the right time. its a lot harder than it sounds but man have I beat people way better than me by having them not be able guess my mix ups and flow charts and being able to read their current strategy then i win quit, I have also lost to people way worse than me pressing random ass buttons because somehow them not following the game rules works and and I just happened to start off with a combo with enough frames to be countered. Like using a different move I coulda won its rock, paper, scissors with more options but luck is still very much there. Titan fall 2 A good team thats balanced out can get fucked up if the worse team has 2 really good players distributing the damage just between them getting their titans out first and changing the game tide. Hell in real life competition luck exists. If I could remove luck from the equation of mma and video games I would....Scratch that just remove it it when luck works against me. There is just no such thing as fair. Luck is always random and always a huge influence over everything. Like if you were able to have every competition where the competitors were close in skill through out history play out a 100 different times who knows how the result would be each time. I bet they wouldn't be the same each time. Also fighting games are the most fair games on this planet and the least played.

However, having a bad internal reaction is, in my opinion, a sexist implicit bias. Can’t immediately call someone an asshole for that as everyone has biases, but if he’s unwilling to have an open mind after talking with his wife then he’s double TA.",0,-37

politics,"&gt;I think you interact with people you disrespect just so that you can assign your own incorrect assessment on their words to set up your insults.  

When you take a position you can't back up with facts, no assumptions are needed.  It's very obvious. 

&gt;Of COURSE the chair has input. Every senator has input! 

Every Senator has input for their own assignments.  There are no votes on committee members.  The decisions are made by the party leader.  And no Democrat has control over who the Republicans put on the committee.  And you can't throw people off the committee without good reason (think Steve King).  The Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee in the 102nd Congress (1991-1993) were the exact same as the members in the 101st Congress.  So you're seriously blaming Joe Biden because, after the 1988 elections, Democrats didn't put Barbara Mikulski on the committee in preparation for a Supreme Court hearing in 1991?  Absolutely ridiculous.   You're stretching like no one has ever stretched before to find a way to blame Joe Biden. 

&gt;Just because the chair isn't the *final arbiter* doesn't mean they don't have a say.  I said *input*, not control. At the very least, they have their own vote and their own voice when the committee members are chosen.  And I never said or implied that members are selected for specific hearings.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The Senate lawyer questioning Blasey-Ford *worked* for republicans.  Kavanaugh was confirmed. 

That was a tactic to save Republicans from the embarrassment they faced during the Anita Hill hearing. 

And why would Democrats have brought in a lawyer to question Hill?  That doesn't make sense.  You do that if you think the person testifying might be lying.  Counsel is brought in by Senators who oppose the person testifying. 

What you're looking for is for the Democrats to have brought in a lawyer to question Thomas.  And that was unnecessary.  The lawyer did nothing to enhance the Kavanaugh hearing.  Democrats didn't need to hide behind anyone to question Thomas. 

You're literally just throwing bullshit at the wall to see what sticks and these attempts are so random that I have to keep your dumb theories consistent for you.  I don't see how this is easier for you than simply looking up the committee rules to back up your opinion.",0,1

They pay way, way more than the average uber rich person who gets their income through dividends or other capital gains and only pays 15% (less than half the less wealthy guy/woman who earns a wage).

With “this story sucks” you’re talking about this season? Or..? Because if it sucks then why are you here? I get that people complain about the OUT OF SOURCES last seasons (you said it yourself) but to call it Transformers 9 is just wrong. When I talk about Game of Thrones I think of it as whole, we’ve already seen political intrigue and cunning dialogues especially with characters such as LF, early Varys (when he mattered, he should be dead by now), TL, etc etc. Imagine 8 seasons of just that, betrayal after betrayal x100 or Littlefinger’s many accents. It would be boring. The action had to happen at some point. 

Also why do I get the feeling that you’re being passive aggressive with me? “If you were even watching then” Dude I started my love for Game of Trones in the early 2000s. You can call me an idiot if you want, I certainly don’t believe that being happy because one of the stories you love is reaching it’s end should be labeled as being an idiot or happy because “at least it’s something”. Again, I get the criticism and I want you to know that I do understand what you’re talking about. But Game of Thrones will never be Transformers 9.

There are multiple avenues that the operator/ dispatcher (depending on how their roles are divided) could have pursued to determine the address of the caller. They could have replayed the 911 tape. They could have called the 911 caller back. They could have checked in house/ public records for the phone number. If it was a cell phone, they could have contacted the service provider and obtained subscriber information.

It gets busy sometimes and things can fall through the cracks, but given the nature of the call and the fact that two officers spent 30 minutes looking for the address I think more should have been done.

Edit: I skimmed the article and missed that the suspect called from a 911 phone. My other points still stand. If someone calls in reporting they're going to commit a murder and your officers can't find the address you better get a supervisor to pull the recording.",0,45

He could have picked up another shield by going to Wakanda to pick up some more vibranium then have Howard Stark make him a new one to go fight in the Cold War and then end up at the bed side of the Steve Rogers they found in the ice to tell him all about Thanos and prevent that Universe from going through the snap. After which he gets Tony and Bruce to build a new device to get him back to the Main Timeline using the GPS he used to get there a week before he left. Then watching himself time travel out goes and sits on the bench with the shield he used from the other universe.

In fact this is the only way this could have happened. There was only a limited number of shields made, all of which were accounted for before the final battle. The one the old Cap gave had to have come some place else because he didn't take one with him into the past.

Bran is impossible to read these days. Never shows any emotion at all. For the most part he appears to only use exactly the number of words he needs to get his chess pieces to move into position.

If not, and the battle at King's Landing is really all that is left, then it hardly seems like a fair fight. Bran will give just the right person exactly the right item/motivation they end up needing when they reach a pivotal moment.

First, Steve's shield broke apart in chunks, as opposed to the vision, where his shield is shown to be broken more or less in half.

But that's a minor detail, more importantly there are several parts of the vision that would've been impossible by that point of the movie. Natasha couldn't have been dead on the ground, because she was already dead on a distant planet in an alternate timeline. The Chitari wouldn't be flying away into a wormhole to reach Earth, because the battle took place on Earth, so they'd be flying towards Tony, not away.

And of course, if Tony hadn't stolen the Infinity Stones, everyone would've been dusted, (*everyone* including the Chitari) so that situation couldn't have happened, because nothing would happen, because there'd be nothing left to happen.

MortalKombat,"I'm starting to wonder if I am wasting my braincells on debating with you. Did your interest shift to semantics now? Are you a low-grade troll I fell for? You demand answers and arguments, but fail to acknowledge any of your conversation partners.

One last try.

When people discuss ""loot boxes"", they do so with the background of corporate greed and microtransactions. The 'loot boxes' in MK11 (yes, there are boxes of loot, albeit not fully random, but rather predetermined for all players, and simply location-swapped per player, thus everyone gets the same rewards) are not guarded behind microtransactions. Money cannot be used to attain them.

So yes, you could theoretically argue that they maintain the spirit of greedy evil corporations by providing players with a dopamine hit that could potentially be seen as exploitative, but again, real money is not involved in the attainment of these boxes, and whether or not people unlock them makes no monetary difference to the company.

YTA because it seems like you shamed your daughter for beginning to explore her sexuality, which is absolutely normal at her age, and which she was also doing with what she understood to be explicit permission from her mum.

However, I also think your wife is also the AH. She should have had this discussion and came to a consensus with you way before this even came up, so that when it came time to talk to your 12yo about it, you had a decision in place and could present a united front. There's always the possibility your daughter asked her not to, as she was embarrassed and felt more comfortable talking to her female parent about it.

And just like Canada, England and Norway, doctors are not forced to take it. They can work as cash only doctors... few do, mind you. The same reason few doctors in America do that currently. Cash-only doctors typically service the ultra-wealthy, providing concierge medicine.

He will continually not only talk about himself, but also seem unable to conceptualize anyone else as important. 

It took a long time, but I (and a group of our other friends) figured out how to affect his drunken behavior. We recorded how he acted when he was drunk. The self absorbed behavior of their drunken self will usually elicit guilt in their sober minds. They need to see for themselves what they’re like while intoxicated. Social pressure will do the job for you as long as you aren’t directly confrontational. When given no enemies for defense mechanisms to target, the truth will eventually sink into the sober mind. Drunken actions follow sober thoughts, so they should slowly change.

What are the default settings of ""those TV's?"" There is no standard for the television hardware manufacturers, so using a reference monitor in the studio is required and editing/grading to a standard is required. The same is true in audio production.

The issues some people had with the episode were either due to compression caused by the CDN's distributing the content being overloaded and having to compensate with more compression, or people who have their TV's set up improperly (or some combination of both.)

Whether you are creating audio or video content, it's not the creator's job to set up your listening/viewing equipment properly. If a musical artist releases a song with experimental deep bass tones under 60Hz, and I have my equalizer set to not play sounds under 60Hz, is it the artist's fault? Should the artist restrict his creativity to account for bad speaker setup or my EQ preferences? It's all fine and dandy testing something on a decent car stereo system, but what about a car stereo that has the EQ set up in a funky way due to the user? How do you account for that? Adjusting it to match the improperly set up equipment will ruin it on other equipment.

The same applies to this episode. It was a battle fought in a blizzard in the middle of the night. If it were bright, it wouldn't be realistic or convey the mood that was intended. If people have set their TV to a high contrast mode that crushes highlights and lowlight details, that's not the creators fault. Saying it is, shows a rudimentary understanding of how the technology behind it all works.

No one said anything about being poor. You can use a shitty TV and as long as it is set up properly, you can see everything just fine. I've downloaded a copy of the episode, all details are within spec. per my testing. I have a shitty LED TV in my garage, and I can see everything just fine on the shitty TV, as well as my OLED TV, because both are calibrated correctly.

If you've gone back and viewed it on your TV again now that compression/distribution aren't as much of an issue, and you still can't see the details in the dark scenes, you'll be much more productive if you spent your time learning how to do a basic calibration on your TV, then complaining about how professionals who are at the top of their game (or else they wouldn't be working on the worlds most popular and anticipated show,) are bad at their job.",0,1

You mean when Theon spent thirty seconds letting NK know exactly how he was going to attack and giving every chance for NK to counter? Nah, I didn’t miss that.

&gt;Or when a White Walker kicked Jon and he flew like 10 yards?

Yeah, and crossbow bolts can hurl someone backward five feet and pin them against a wall without any recoil on the shooter. It’s a TV show, it looks cool.

None of these constitutes proof that it’s impossible to get the drop on a WW or the NK specifically. They’re strong and fast. So are like half the main characters. Like I said, we’ve seen them killed already.

&gt;Not to mention if you watch that scene again he holds her for a good second or two before she even drops the dagger. He had more than enough time to tear her apart he just inexplicably paused for dramatic effect because the plot demanded it.

WWs still take time to process information. Arya was ready and NK wasn’t. This is such a weird quibble. It’s not like they locked eyes and screamed at each other for a half hour like a DBZ fight.

&gt;My point here is that the NK has a reputation. He nearly wiped out all of civilization in the past. I'm really supposed to believe no one could get the drop on him if it's this easy? That's what seems illogical to me.

At what point during the last 10,000 years or whatever did the NK expose himself enough that anyone could stab him? At what point was he ever so close to victory that he might be distracted enough to let his guard down? They even make a point of his hubris with all his little smirks.

&gt;He was built up since the first episode as a force of nature, something greater than the realms of men that would punish them for their petty squables over the Iron Throne. That has been repeated over and over and over again so many times it's impossible to miss. Instead of being that force of nature punishing a divided humanity he vanishes in one night against the first line of defense passed the Wall.

If he’s supposed to teach them the error of squabbling over thrones, that’s pretty clearly your own prediction rather than anything explicitly said in the show. Sorry that didn’t pan out, but that’s the issue with predictions I guess.

&gt;Really? Nedd Stark loses his head because he chose honor over saving his own neck. Robb Stark and his family are massacred because he did not honor his responsibilities as a Lord. Stannis has his army destroyed because he was too stubborn and lost his humanity in his lust for the throne and failed to see through Melisandre's lies, sacrificing the only thing that mattered to him and losing the faith of his men. Jon Snow fought for the greater good against tradition to help the Wildlings and paid the price of being massacred by his own men.

AskReddit,"Not me specifically but a friend of mine.
She got laid off from her office job and was having a hard time finding work.
She applied and got a job as a mail carrier for USPS in the rural area where they live.

This was 80% walking and 20% driving.
Over three months she lost almost 50lbs just drinking water and walking almost 10miles a day.

This took her from 230 to 180, another three months and she was down to 150. 

Her husband however was almost 400lbs and had no stamina from what she was telling me.

He always told her he was too tired to help with the kids or to do anything really other than go to work (Sit behind a desk and do nothing after getting home) and relax.

She started getting more active since now she had more energy from being generally more healthy.
She did the shopping so she bought healthy foods that her husband didn’t like and was always complaining.
After about a year and then 3 months of counseling that went nowhere she filed for divorce.

She ended up spending alimony on surgery to remove excess skin from being overweight and making herself feel better about her body in the mirror. Nothing enhancing just nipping and tucking where weight loss and exercise wasn’t fixing like tummy flab, arm flab etc.

She tells me all the time if she never lost her job and didn’t become a mail carrier that she would have been content to stay with him, but after getting in shape she realized how bad and toxic he was for her.

She tried to make it work and encouraged him to be better for himself (She didn’t want to have kids with a fat lazy slob anymore and I don’t blame her) but he showed no ambition or will to change.

She doesn’t feel bad at all about it and is now going out with an amazing guy that challenges her and supports her active lifestyle",0,12

The lore and complexity is what makes them exceptional, but Martin is really struggling with that complexity. What makes them great is probably also what will make them unfinished, and I have a hard time putting unfinished work on a pedestal.  

If he manages to finish the series or delegates someone who can, and the books are well done (i.e., wrapped up the dozens of plots well, and better in quality than the last two books), then he'll definitely have an argument for a top 3 fantasy series, and perhaps the most culturally significant one since LOTR.",0,3

My question is this, when he is sent back in time to put the stones back, how does he get to the real timeline to do so? The devices they have lets you go past in your timeline and start a new branch. Nowhere did they discuss labeling and going to specific branches. I suspect he went back and attempted to put stuff back in place, to only end up leaving two of each stone, not that it matters. I just dont get how he can come back to timeline a as old, because again he has no way to select a specific branch. Only way to come back to your branch is to use the main quantum machine, which bounces you back to your 'home'. But he didnt come back on the device, which means he time traveled to get there when he came back old.

dankmemes,"Has society really become so debased in recent times that we signal our respect to others by typing ""F""? How pathetic. That to me doesn't show respect at all, it shows complete lunacy and laziness. I angry react every comment I see with just an F. I do feel that this is part of a wider phenomenon where people don't really understand how to show genuine gratitude and sincere feelings anymore. Essentially, we are more inclined to take people for granted to the extent that we would rather press a single letter on a keyboard to acknowledge what someone has done or said, rather than take some time out to explain why we are grateful. It's ridiculous and this practice should be stopped immediately. No surprises that this practice originates from an internet game - ""Call of Duty"", where people literally press F for respects. I think this sums up everything succinctly. I don't expect basement-dwellers jacking off furiously whilst simultaneously shooting down grandmas and hoes to know the definition of respect. It is important to show our appreciation for others. Stop being a douchebag and ""pressing F"". It annoys the hell out of me, and I'm sure people look down on you for engaging in such a practice.

Whether or not it's fair, some people would consider this concerning enough to contact CPS. I work with children and teens and have attended numerous seminars (edit: seminars about what to look for concerning possible abuse and neglect) and one of the things we're told to look out for is children participating in sexual behavior that is too mature for them. 

Everyone here is saying ""but 12 year olds masturbate"" and that is absolutely true. Children often begin to do so as young as 5. That's not the issue here, and hearing that a preteen was masturbating shouldn't raise red flags for anyone. Hearing that a 12-year-old has been given a SEX TOY by her PARENTS would ABSOLUTELY raise red flags for many people. It is not normal for her age, puberty or no she emotionally she is still a child.

soccer,"**""I had two bottles of wine, I broke one in the head of one guy and I ran away""**, explains the protagonist of The Lord of the Rings

&amp;#x200B;

The popular and much loved character of the Lord of the Rings, Aragorn, played by Viggo Mortensen, would surely have faced them sword in hand. But the actor, the real person, has been more cautious. The fact is that the Argentine actor, who has never hidden his passion for football and more specifically for the San Lorenzo de Almagro, to the point that he took a pin from his club during the last Oscars Awards, has explained how he escaped a dangerous brawl with ultras from Real Madrid.

The radical fans attacked him thinking he was a Barcelona fan. It happened in 2006 when Viggo Mortensen, who was immersed in the shooting of Captain Alatriste's film, was mistaken for a Barça supporter.

The actor decided to tell the anecdote 13 years later. It was the day in which his team lost 1-7 against Boca, a match he saw in Madrid with director Agustín Díaz Yanes. The director invited him to dinner at his house, preparing for the occasion. ""I took flags, shirts, hats, scarves ... Then they make us a goal, two goals, three goals ... I sank in the armchair"", reveals in radio 'Vorterix'.

However, the worst came after the game. ""I was in the Puerta del Sol, the ultras saw the colors of my clothing and thought i was a Barça supporter. Those bald guys started to say ugly things and hitting me. I had two bottles of wine, I broke one in the head of one and I ran away. ""

When arriving at the house of Agustín Díaz Yanes, the director asked him if it was blood what he wore on his shirt. Not to worry his friend, he said no, that it was wine.",0,89

unpopularopinion,"Nobody ever said it was the only reason. They're just telling you that it's the CURRENT reason.

CO2 spikes have happened before in Earth's geological history… but there hasn't been a natural reason for THIS spike… and it's quite a fucking massive spike. So when you break it down it looks like this:

- We know that CO2 warms the planet.
- We know that CO2 can be released in massive quantities naturally because that's happened before.
- We know that such a massive natural release hasn't happened recently.
- We know that a massive man-made release has been happening constantly for the last century+
- We can see from records and ice sampling that the recent CO2 releases are very significant.
- When you add all that up, **we are the volcano.**

This is also very basic logic.

Some people like to argue that the amount we release is small compared to massive volcanoes, which is true, but it's also CONSTANT. We're doing it 24/7 for over a hundred years and we're doing more and more every day. Over time this adds up to something which should concern everyone.",0,4

This man about 65-70 came in. He was old but not super old. A lot of good life left in him. 

Was in town visiting when he started coughing up blood. His aorta was about to burst. It was bad. His wife was there with him the whole time. 

We counseled him on the options. The highest risk surgery you could imagine. That's what he faced. Choose that or choose dying in 3-5 days by coughing up and choking and stifling on your blood as it drowns and suffocates you as you gasp for air while your aorta pumps blood out of your mouth. 

I think he knew. He had a thousand yard stare the whole time he was in the ICU. Stoic. He hadn't accepted death. But he had accepted his circumstances. 

He decided to opt for surgery. 

He made it through surgery. But never woke up. Made it back to the unit intubated. And just couldn't pull through from the procedure. Just took too much from him. 

I just always put myself in his shoes. To try and understand how I would feel. 

I practically know I will die from surgery. I know I will not wake up. I am actively making this decision to try, but chances are slim. I'm not telling a man to hold a gun to my head and kill me.... But the outcome is the same.... Right? All that is different is I get wheeled to a room and get some Ativan to calm my nerves and in a consciousless state for a day or two until I pass. 

I think of how he mentally prepared himself. Did he sleep the night before? Would I cry like a baby being wheeled to the OR, Backing out at the last minute to spend a futile few extra hours with my wife? His wife sat by his side for those two days waiting for him to wake up.

unpopularopinion,"I thought Jyn's motivation was established well enough with her father's death.  She saw the Empire take her father and kill her mother. It was a supremely powerful force imposed on her world while her childhood heroes (parents) could do nothing against it. Her adoptive father fought the Empire, but he devolved into impotent madness and abandoned her. As far as Jyn is concerned, the Empire is invincible while the Rebels are pathetically delusional.

Then the turn. Her father is alive. Not only alive but still resisting. He was never beaten by the Empire, he was playing the long game. He was avenging Jyn's mother and pulling the wool over the man who broke up their family. And he needs Jyn's help. She rushes to help her father, but all she can salvage is his mission and dying wish. She's not an angsty pessimist anymore; she's a child desperate to keep her family's legacy going. Desperate to cling to this last spark of hope and to punish the Empire in a meaningful way.

Jyn doesn't really care about the Rebellion's members or their politics, only in the shared goal of hurting the Empire. Her speech feels forced because it kinda is. She isn't sold on the Rebellion so much as on her Father's specific plan. In a way, she's a very human character for this.",0,1

unpopularopinion,"I always struggled with mental health issues. Even during school. Even when I claimed my diagnosis (which was incorrect, I actually don’t have depression or anxiety, but something arguably worse) I was sure not to flaunt it. The people I knew who wore it like an accessory, they were popular enough, but everyone also talked shit about them behind their backs because they were strange and used their illness in this way, making it look like something manufactured. This was years ago, but I’ve noticed people who used to make fun of me for behaviors linked to my mental illness now proclaim they have ‘so much anxiety that their anxiety has anxiety’. Meanwhile I feel like I can’t even be open about what I have because people still stigmatize it (and part of it is thanks to a high volume of “fakers”). In short, I don’t know that this is an unpopular opinion or not, but I do think we’re going to hit the point where saying you have this stuff will mean nothing.

news,"Following the Christchurch shooting and the news that NZ would be changing it's gun laws, I commented how glad I was and I ended up getting some pretty alarming messages from pro-gun American's (based on post history) who genuinely believe that having a gun on you means you'll instantly diffuse the situation and save everyones lives.

**Edit:** Since some people seem to take issue with this view, I should have put a disclaimer saying I am from New Zealand. I'd also like to say that the alarming messages included death threats so ya know, not exactly looking too favourable on that topic currently.

To answer one of the most debated things here, you can look at the use of guns in two ways: They act as a deterrent, or they escalate.

If we take the first road, owning guns act as a deterrent because the threat of harm will prevent offensive action being taken. This is the exact same view that some countries have towards nuclear weapons and is equally a contentious topic. Your neighbour owns a gun, so therefore you are less likely to burgle him because he might shoot you, right?

But what if you too had a gun, and you bring it with you? Now you've got two offensive weapons and an incredibly dangerous situation. This is a likely outcome if you are legally allowed to own them.

The second road is what lead to the Cuba Missile Crisis and, shockingly, the reason that it was deescalated was through diplomacy and the removal of the Jupiter missiles from Turkey (and debatably Italy too). The fact that the US had a vastly superior arsenal did not factor into either sides decision-making process.

The removal of the weapons (guns if we drop the analogy) lead to a de-escalation of tensions. The likelihood of someone shooting you is dramatically decreased if guns are illegal or far more tightly regulated. Yes, there will be cases where one person has a gun and the other is unarmed and dies as a result, but those are the outliers and are such a minuscule amount of cases.",1,-3

Edit: AAANd with genital it is not that linear. Herpes gets more common with age since they have simply had more sexual exposures. And also women get infected more easily. So mid 30 women will have the biggest part of that 1 in 5. Teen males the smallest part etc.

We could say the same thing for Japan for instance. Largely a homogenous population.

We (USA) have a large melting pot of a population, and as such have widely different demands of our healthcare system. It's much easier to prepare and maintain treatments for people with similar genetic backgrounds. Same for generally unified cultures. Most likely due to dietary and environmental factors. The same cannot be said for the US. It's too big, too different, and generally not very efficiently managed in a centralized manner.

We do have a strong economy and abundant resources. Is it strongly enough to scale and support unified healthcare for our diverse population? I have a tendency to think it will balloon out of control and will not work. Costs will be astronomical, much more so than projections. I mean look at our VA system. This should be the shining example of what socialized healthcare should be in the US. We should be taking care of our soldiers, but the VA is generally trash. Veterans healthcare outcomes suck. I mean if you can't trust them to take care of those who gave all, can you trust them to take care of those who have nothing? I have no faith in that system.

It's also proven we aren't smart enough to manage our money responsibly. Take a look at any government ledger. Further adding to it being more infeasible.

I get that you think socialized healthcare is some magic bullet, but it isn't. The argument was more Norway has just about perfect conditions to pull this off, and even then it still has issues. I don't think the US could effectively pull it off and the conditions to do it aren't really there. Can it be better than it is? Certainly.",0,3

Several years ago (pre-2014), I believe it was on Zach Lowe's podcast, a sportswriter (I want to say Arnovitz, but I'm not sure) relayed a story about interviewing CP3 where he got into a tense back-and-forth with CP around a series of 'spirit of the rule' type questions where he was asking him about whether or not he thought flopping, grabbing arms, and otherwise trying to do 'illegal' things on the court was 'moral' or within 'the spirit of the game/rule' and the sportswriter got really frustrated because CP was pretending to not understand the concept and conflating 'getting caught' with 'doing wrong'. Essentially, CP seems to believe that what makes a thing 'bad' is whether or not you are caught doing it. 

You can understand so much of CP's career in light of this comment. From the punching of dicks, the flopping, his routine excessive contact, etc. all of the things people dislike about CP are summed up in that exchange. He's an immoral, dirty basketball player that most importantly **should not be president of the NBA players' union** because he routinely shows little to no respect for his colleagues, as evidenced by his on court behavior.",0,272

It’s completely unrecognizable from Seasons 1-4 of the “moving image.” When people make bad decisions in Seasons 1-4, they pay for it with their life or another way. Ned Stark died because he made bad decisions. Robb died because he made bad decisions. Anyone used to be subject to the basic law of consequences. It doesn’t matter if you were thought of as a main character, if your character flaw showed itself in a bad decision, you were screwed. But now, people get away with mistake after mistake. Instead of earning their place, now a writer just gives it to them. Most of the should be dead, not only from last night, but from mistakes and poor decision during the last few seasons. Arya shouldn’t even be there to save the day because she was stabbed in the abdomen and then swam in the sewers. Meanwhile Ned Stark barely survives an infection from a stab in the leg and Drago dies of infection from a mere flesh wound. There were consequences before and plot armor didn’t save you.

re: 1

Abolition of the gold standard was a failure of the government because it failed to play by  its own rules which were agreed during the Bretton Woods conference. The government agreed to maintain a ratio but instead inflated unsustainably, created diplomatic crises when other countries wanted to reclaim their gold reserves over the overleveraged money supply and ultimately reneged on the deal by closing the ""gold window"".

re: 2 

Crypto-currencies do not function as money yet because they do not have established markets and are currently used as speculative instruments.  Money needs markets. Without markets nothing can be money. This is why governments when creating legal tender make it a tool for paying taxes and other legal debts thus *forcing* a creation of the markets.

The fact that governments do whatever they can to fight them - because at this stage crypto prevents government control of money supply - is also important, but it's also a fact that crypto is in its infancy. Markets develop over time. You can develop markets for precious metals and you can develop markets for cigarettes.  To state ""it's not money"" without qualifiers is a sign of ignorance.

re: 3

Central banks do nothing but continue with rampant inflation of the money supply. It's just being coordinated so relative inflation remains low but if you wonder where the sudden spikes in prices of certain goods like education, healthcare or housing comes from... all from inflation being re-directed into those markets.

What is relative inflation? Well since all currencies are free-floating and their value depends on supply and demand you can hide inflation by forcing all emitters of money to inflate at an agreed-upon rate. This leads to lack of capital flight between currencies and limits the amount of inflation that can be seen by the depreciation of currency vs other currencies. But the cost of living vs income continues to widen over long term.

Also to understand relative inflation check the exchange rate for Swiss Franc during the Euro crisis around 2013 or so. Swiss Franc shot into the sky and the Swiss central bank was forced to expand money supply massively to prevent death by strangulation with overvaluation of the Franc vs Euro, Dollar and Pound.

re: 4

Most of ""genius economists"" are not genius ""economists"". Friedman was a poor economist, as was Keynes, as was Krugman, as was Stiglitz. Most of those people were known for their political economy as well and creating policy prescriptions and rationalizations rather than developing methodology, models and providing new insights. 

The real  ""genius economists"" were often non-economists, like Nash because real economics is boring. Opinions on why you getting the money is right and ignorant moralizing on the other hand - which is what you do - is soo very popular.

Also Hayek's prize came for re-formulation of the theory of the business cycle which while not his own is the only attempt at correct explanation of the purely economic dimension of the business cycle. Keynes talks about animal instincts which explains motivation but not why markets magically find mountains of money to speculate with. Hayek explained it - as well as how the booms form and how they are ultimately always doomed to fail. He also explained that it is not the bust but the boom which is the ""Bad"" part and bust simply re-sets the economy to a healthy equilibrium. That it costs businesses, jobs and savings is the fault of the boom and not the correction.

No other widely recognized economist did that since most want to get paid by government institutions so they say the politically correct line - the one you are repeating - which is economically wrong but politically correct. And that is apparently more important. Bad economics is good economics when it is good for politicians.

re: 5

Considering that the alternative in Chile and Portugal was a communist revolution... yes he did care about *relative* freedom. He was also an economist so he focused on real alternatives and economic freedom, not imaginary freedoms that leftist authoritarians proclaim as they take over and monopolize entire economies and then proceed to steal resources that ""belong to the people"" at a much greater rate than the worst capitalist.

Hayek also criticized the western capitalist model and was far more lenient toward certain government programs (although not toward their efficiency or the real motivation behind them) than for example Friedman.

worldnews,"&gt; The constitution does not support Guaido as ruler. It would only support him in the case of an illegitimate election as a temporary president to set up a NEW election.

Which they had an illegitimate election.  After the opposition won a super majority, Maduro and his allies stripped the national assembly of all power, and created a constituent national assembly.  The new Constituent national assembly maduro created made new last minute rules to running in the election, those rules barred a lot of opposition from running.  This was also why they protested and view the election as illegitimate, because they don't recognize the power of the constituent assembly.

&gt;Guaido did not even run in the last election, nobody voted for him president. That isn't democracy.

This has everything to do with shame and [fear of vulnerability.](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability/transcript?language=en)

People set unrealistic expectations because they are ashamed of themselves. This is a way of setting up a situation so that our most cogent fears come to life. That is, shifting the goalposts for ourselves and others until we feel our fears will be validated. This, instead of focusing on what we need from a person *Right Now.* Shame says that what we need right now isn't valid.

People with feelings of shame often deal with it by trying to make *uncertain* things into what they believe as certainties. Such as, a person's interest and love in the future.",0,1
AmItheAsshole,"ESH. And if the daughter was actually looking to buy a sex toy she is too. The expectation that you have to indulge that need is ridiculous. It’s not even a need, unless she is literally harming herself on other objects. The idea that everyone is pushing here that you should have to buy it makes me insanely uncomfortable (even though I do understand masturbation is natural). I thought these products were only meant for people that were 18+. I honestly believe like the comments would be much different if this were talking about fleshlights.",0,1

Minden teljesen jó volt, nagyon olajozva ment az oltás, semmi panaszom nem lehet. Oltás előtt kaptam kitölteni egy hibrid angol/magyar oltási igazolványt (név, szül.dátum, TAJ szám), azt visszakaptam oltás után minden adattal kitöltve.

Mellékhatás csak másnapra jött ki egy kb. estig tartó szédülésben (nem volt kellemes, inkább fájt volna valamim a karom mellett), de mára teljesen eltűnt, és csak enyhe karfájás maradt.

Az oltásra beengedés előtt elég nagy volt a tumultus a szűk folyosón, de összességében mindenki kedves és segítőkész volt. Mellékhatás semmi, némi izomfájdalom a szúrás helyén, de ez várható volt.

With that said, at that age I (I was born female and identify as female) played on a boys football team. I was the best and strongest player on that team by a long shot. Kids at that age regardless of gender are very similar and in fact males mature less quickly, i was slightly bigger than my teammates at the time but I was also a good athlete and had been playing many sports my whole life. Béa being a good player probably has little to do with the fact that she’s a m to f transgender person. I would not bring the fact that her team tends to win up, i just don’t really think it’s relevant. She may just be talented. Also, keep in mind that children can be prejudice towards people who they perceive as different from them. Not to say that your kid is, but just to keep that in mind too and be sure to hear what Béa and her parents have to say. There’s a good chance Bea experiences bullying in some capacity and she may be acting out. Be gentle with the situation, but the school and her parents need to make sure she’s well behaved. Maybe teachers go easier on her because of the fact that she’s trans, which clearly is of no benefit to her or anybody else.

AmItheAsshole,"NAH, however, you could be NTA depending on the buyers intentions .

A recent eBay anecdote. I recently sold a pair of brand new in the box shoes on eBay with pictures of the size of the shoes(on the tongue and on the box). Someone purchased the shoes, received them and then messaged me that the shoes didn't fit and they must have been men's size X and not women's size X(they weren't). I offered a refund if she sent the shoes back in the condition she received them(at this point she hadn't gone through the official eBay returns procedure). She sent back the original box I sent her, with the original shoebox inside that box with all the packing materials, and no shoes. Empty box. Then messaged me a bunch asking where her refund was, and that the shoes were in the box, etc. etc. I basically told her she knew damn well she shipped me an empty box.  She contacted eBay and requested a refund and that they look at the case, and then they issued her a refund from my PayPal. I had to get eBay involved and they looked through our message history and then they refunded me back the money and I reported her(always use eBay messenger!). It was a major pain in the ass, and eBay almost always sides with the buyer. You also can't leave bad feedback for a buyer, so you'll never know if someone buying your stuff has pulled this shit before. I'm guessing she tried to pull something like this before since they quickly refunded my cash. Now every auction I do is a no returns auction. 

TL;DR Lady returns empty box, still tries to get money, eBay gives it to her, then gives it back to me, probably because she's done this before.",0,3

Imagine  the following climactic sequence. Obviously the events leading to it  would be different than the ones we've seen in the actual episode , but  humor me.

""Daenerys,  Jorah and Jon are surrounded by the Whitewalkers in the Godswood. Jorah  is mortally wounded, gasping for his last breaths in the arms of his  queen. Jon draws his sword and prepares for the onslaught. As the  Whitewalkers rush the trio, Daenerys sees something in the sky above  them. She hesitates for a moment but as Jon is overwhelmed by the  frenzied enemies, she grips Jorah tighter and screams at the top of her  lungs. “Drakkarys!”. Two massive plumes of fire bathe the ground where  our heroes and the horde of Whitewalkers occupy. The Night King turns  his sight from Bran to witness the fire. What a moment ago was a swirl  of cloth and iron and undead flesh and bone is now a pile of drifting  ashes, with the exception of two figures that still linger in the  cinders.

Looking up from her hands that  now hold charcoal dust, Daenerys sees a bewildered, unscathed, unburned  Jon. She now knows that his words were true. And Jon himself fully  realizes for the first time that same truth as his eyes meet the  surprised gaze of the Night King. “Azor Ahai”, Mellisandre whispers  under her breath. A faint smile forms in Bran's face. With his blade  still glowing red from the dragonfire baptism and his scorched armor  that makes the cold rain hiss as it touches it, a reassured Aegon  Targaryen hurls with fury towards the Frozen Lord.

Steel  clashes as the two make contact. As the fight goes on, Jon realizes  that fury and righteousness alone are no match to the old magic of his  foe. The Night King is better than him. ""Far Better"". Thrown to the  ground after a failed attack, the northman feels desperation clutching  him into its icy claws. Towering over him ready to deliver the final  blow, the Night King's eyes catch a glimpse of a shadow just out of  sight. There's something there. Someone. Noone.""

gameofthrones,Could be your right. Supposedly there is magic there. They talk about no one knowing what’s in the lower levels. Maybe something was disturbed or destroyed down there.

relationship_advice,"I would say the latest is at whatever point I would start considering it cheating. If you're dating non-exclusively and can still fuck others, it's not *necessary* to bring it up right away. If you *only* date exclusively, I'd bring it up immediately. I think it'd be best to bring it up as early as possible since it might be a deal breaker for some people, but I have to imagine that people who consider porn cheating don't date non-exclusively for long, if at all. 

It's hard for me to say though, since as I mentioned I'm not the one that feels that way, and I'm a heavy communicator. It's basically my love-language. So if I didn't feel comfortable talking about it with someone, I'd probably already be incompatible with them. Plus I'm married, so it's quite a non-issue these days.

But talking about our beliefs and why we have them is one of the first things I do when bonding with someone. So it would come up naturally for me very quickly. Like, before we started dating or on the first date. I don't think that would change if my views happened to be more conservative than they actually are.",0,4

He can be killed but you would have to do more than just run up to him. I thought the scene with jon and theo trying to do that was a good depiction of that. And I thought it was great that he just instantly spins around and grabs her not only by the neck but the dagger hand at the same time.

This shit can be abused and we can find things that are ""wrong"" with people we don't like. Races we don't like. Jail them, and because they are jailed, strip away their voting rights. These criminals are US citizens, whether you like it or not, and I'm pretty sure that they, too, want to better the country they live in.

Showerthoughts,"So 100% of the solar systems we have been to have life, the nearest star in the nearest constellation has a planet with earth like qualities and the galaxy alone has a ridiculous amount of stars, let alone if we include the entire universe.

To think that we are the only world out of the whole vastness of the universe is, to me, narcissistic in the extreme.

Edit: I forgot to add that life and life intelligent enough to talk between solar systems are 2 very different concepts.

I have no doubt that life exists on other worlds, however considering the vastness of space and how short our own history is, it is entirely possible that a species could rise and fall with out ever meeting an alien. It's a sad thought, but one that was backed by some compelling information.

Edit 2: also, the whole of scientific investigation is making a hypothesis and then going about proving it wrong or right. Hawkins had a bunker built in a mountain to find out if dark matter was real. My point is, often in order to get proof you need to believe the proof exists before hand",0,1

You're telling me the best strategy was to give complete and utter control to their enemy and hope he'll leave an opening? That's retardedly bad. Giving your opponent complete control is the worst possible thing. I'm pretty sure the forces of the living *only* needed to trade about 10 to 1 in order to win this fight, maybe like 15:1 if you include recently dead that become raised to fight for the dead. Now 10/15 to 1 isn't exactly ideal, but it isn't exactly unprecedented either for a defending force to achieve this with superior tactics, defenders advantage and high level execution. I'd much rather destroy his whole army and possibly risk his escape (although dragons are probably pretty good at catching runaways) than sacrificing the vast, vast , majority of my forces and HOPING I can predict what an undead being does when he's already killed everybody I know and care about.

Except that thinking and feeling aren't passive, they're active. Perhaps you might consider the concept of neutral.

AskReddit,"My husband and I were driving from New Jersey to Georgia in March of 2015. It was about a 15 hour drive and we were about 13 and a half hours into it. The drive was pretty much a straight shot on the same highway, I-95.

It was about 1am and we’d planned to push through so we could get to the hotel by 3am and at least sleep in a bed instead of the truck. My husband was driving since I’d not had much experience driving his truck, but he was starting to get tired and I’d offered to drive since he was fading. 

Suddenly, we come upon this stretch of Highway that was by far the creepiest, most intense thing I’ve ever seen. The north bound side (other side) of the highway, on a desolate stretch of road, had been completely shut down in both directions. Huge, football-field style spot lights were set up and illuminating the bone chilling scene below. There was an over-turned, burned up tractor trailer, lay across the highway. There were 6-7 completely annihilated, burned up cars - or they could’ve been trucks or SUVs. There was no telling. 

There was soot, blood, sawdust, and some kind of dark fluid all over the road. Surrounding the scene were parked, turned off emergency vehicles. Probably 30 different cars/fire trucks/ambulances/etc., all sitting around the perimeter of the carnage. The scene, though so brightly illuminated we thought we were on a movie set, was completely deserted and silent. No people. No emergency lights. Just a brightly lit horrifying and completely abandoned wreckage site. 

We were somewhere in South Carolina. I think the town was called Florence. 

Found out later that there was a horrible fatal wreck in which a whole family died around 7pm the night before, and they’d just left the entire miles-long stretch of highway closed for hours because clean up had been too much to handle that night. 


That woke us both up to the point of primal fear. I had never seen such a horrible wreckage in my life, my hands were shaking. My husband white knuckled it the final two hours, barely breathing. We both swore we kept seeing figures in the shadows of the shoulder the rest of the drive.",0,3

Most married couples, especially with 12 year old children, should know each other well enough to know where they'd stand on this kind of thing. That being said, the feminists commenting of course exaggerate that you just basically did the worst thing in the world. I'm not going to go into my deep and nuanced views on why SOME sexual repression is a good thing, but in short it's what was required for society's to protect their women and therefore their continued existence. Feminism was needed before because it liberated women from traditions and roles that became obsolete with our society's advancement and development.
